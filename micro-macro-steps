User Stories

# User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field

# User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered

# User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal base equivalent of the binary number that was entered

======================

Micro Stories

-> Create two functions (get input and verify if the input is valid

## verify function

-> define the valid chars
-> verify the length
-> verify if there is the valid chars
-> If everything is true, than return true

## Get input function

-> while the verify funtion is false, do the input question to get the input

## Transform binary to decimal

-> transform input into substrings array
-> get the reverse
-> join everything
-> transform string into array
-> create a loop 
-> print the result
